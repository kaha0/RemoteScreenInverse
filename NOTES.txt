send differential bitmaps!
	-png with transparency, drawn over the old screen?
	-some kind of bitblt pixeltransfer magic? TOSEND := CURRENT xor PREVIOUS ? takhle vytvoøená bitmapa TOSEND nebude sama o sobì dávat smysl, ale to je fuk
		1) entirely GDI+ - slow, watch out how it uses memory
		2) GDI+ & direct bitmap access - somewhat faster, ugly
		3) GDI+ & Bitblt just for srcinvert - memory!, very ugly
		4) entirely GDI, GDI+ just for encoding pngs - fast, efficient memory usage, ugly... not even that ugly really
	always send differential OR compare sizes with full screen bitmap to see which is smaller?
	can differential ever be much bigger than full snapshot? i don't think so and in most cases certainly not
	differential pro quality 0 by se muselo dìlat jinak ! u black&white obrázku to stejnì ani nemá TAKOVEJ smysl...
